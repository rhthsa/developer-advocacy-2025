## What is OpenShift Observability?

[Red Hat® OpenShift® Observability](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-observability) is a comprehensive set of observability capabilities that provides deep insights into the performance and health of OpenShift-based applications and infrastructure across any footprint: the public cloud, on-prem, and edge.
